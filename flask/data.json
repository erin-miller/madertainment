    "category": null,
    "price": "Free",
    "description": "Abstract: Minimum cut problems in graphs are among the most basic questions in algorithm design. We teach them in our classes, use them as standard tools in algorithms research, and apply them to solve real-world problems in a broad range of domains. Yet, after decades of research into designing faster algorithms for these problems, progress on many of the key questions stalled in the late 1990s. This lull of over two decades has been dramatically broken in the last few years with a series of results in rapid progression that have achieved close to optimal solutions for many of the important problems in this area such as global minimum cut, vertex connectivity, and all-pairs minimum cuts. A common theme running through these results is a fundamentally better understanding of how these problems relate to maximum flows, which then allows leveraging recent progress in maximum flow algorithms for solving these problems. In this talk, I will discuss our work on identifying these connections and the results they lead to, focusing on the conceptually new ideas that have driven this progress. I will also outline what lies ahead: the (equally important) questions that we haven\u2019t made progress on and where the challenges of the future lie.\nBio: Debmalya Panigrahi is a Professor of Computer Science at Duke University. His research interests are broadly in the design and analysis of algorithms. In graph algorithms, his recent work has obtained nearly optimal algorithms for fundamental cut problems, overcoming long-standing barriers that have stood for several decades. In algorithms under uncertainty, his recent work has leveraged machine-learned future predictions in the design of online algorithms. Other areas that he has worked in include online and approximation algorithms, combinatorial optimization, algorithmic game theory, and applied algorithms. He is a recipient of an NSF CAREER Award, faculty research awards from Google and Yahoo, a best paper award at SPAA, a best paper honorable mention at WWW, and multiple special issue invitations at FOCS and STOC. He received his PhD from MIT in 2012 where he was a Presidential Fellow.\n ",

    "description": "Abstract: In this talk based on my ACM Breakthrough Award lecture, I recall the journey that led to the invention of fast trace-based just-in-time compilation and the subsequent incorporation of this technique into the Firefox browser as the TraceMonkey JavaScript engine.\n\nAs I will explain in the presentation, my main objective during most of this period was not actually to invent a better just-in-time compiler, but to invent a better wire format for the safe transport of mobile code. In this process, I came up with several innovative mobile-code representations in the hope of replacing JVM bytecode. Unfortunately, in spite of even receiving two U.S. Patents on these inventions, all my efforts to get these ideas adopted failed bitterly; even today, JavaScript is still transmitted as source code.\n\nBut instead, I was able to persuade Mozilla that they needed a JavaScript JIT, and talked them into adopting the totally unproven JIT compilation method that we had just invented at UC Irvine. Because at the time no other browser had a JavaScript JIT (Chrome had not yet been announced), this was not really a critical project for Mozilla, and so the project got the green light. And then Web 2.0 happened...\nBio: Michael Franz is a Distinguished Professor at the University of California, Irvine (UCI) and the director of its Secure Systems and Software Laboratory. He is a Professor of Computer Science in UCI's Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences and a Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (by courtesy) in UCI's Henry Samueli School of Engineering. He is a Fellow of the AAAS, ACM, IEEE, and IFIP, a recipient of ACM's Charles P. Thacker Breakthrough in Computing Award, the IEEE Computer Society's Technical Achievement Award, and a Humboldt Research Award.\n\nProf. Franz was an early pioneer in the areas of mobile code and dynamic compilation. He created an early just-in-time compilation system, contributed to the theory and practice of continuous compilation and optimization, and co-invented the trace compilation technology that eventually became the JavaScript engine in Mozilla\u2019s Firefox browser. His pioneering contributions to computer security include moving-target defenses inspired by biodiversity in nature, and automated multivariant execution. He has graduated 36 Ph.D. students as their primary advisor. Franz received a Dr. sc. techn. degree in Computer Science and a Dipl. Informatik-Ing. ETH degree, both from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, ETH Zurich.",

    "description": "Abstract: Spline smoothing and more generally Gaussian process smoothing have become a successful methodology for estimating a smooth trend or surface from noisy data. Similarly the LASSO and related L1 penalties have become important tools for variable selection and also admit of a Bayesian version based on the Laplace distribution. This project  combines these two approaches as a method to detect discontinuous behavior in an otherwise smooth signal. Every day the Foothills Facility of Denver Water filters more than 250 million gallons of water for the metropolitan area. This process runs continuously and is monitored across an array of filters, each the size of a small swimming pool, at 5 minute intervals. It is important to be able detect anomalous behavior in a filter in a prompt manner or to process past measurements to determine trends. The anomalies take the form of discontinuities or appear as step changes in the smooth filtering cycle. This application is the motivation for a mixed smoothing approach where normal operation is captured by a smoothing spline and the anomalies by basis function coefficients determined by an L1 penalty. As part of this research a frequentist penalty method  is compared against its equivalent Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM) based on Gaussian processes and a Laplace prior for the anomaly coefficients. This talk will discuss some of the challenges in implementing both models. Specifically we study how to choose penalty parameters for the frequentist model and how to formulate then BHM in a way that the MCMC  sampling algorithm mixes efficiently. Both approaches appear to classify anomalies in the filter cycles well with the spline model being much faster but the BHM providing measures of uncertainty in the detected anomalies. The similarities between these frequentist and Bayesian models relies on the correspondence between splines and Gaussian processes. This was first described by Grace Wahba, a long-time faculty member of the UW statistics department, and George Kimeldorf. Some background for this connection will be given as part of developing the Bayesian model.",

Indeed, in addition to guiding practical model training and evaluation, they can help improve mental models about system components. We will explore variations on this theme, seeing how visualization principles can inform deep learning practice and highlighting how visualization has shaped the community\u2019s understanding of memory and attention mechanisms. We will visit both serious (https://go.wisc.edu/d3s65o, https://go.wisc.edu/m9llck) and fanciful (https://go.wisc.edu/lk38zd) visualizations from my past projects, with the goal that you might leave with at least one visualization idea relevant to your work. Finally, I will offer early thoughts on how visualization of model-derived representations can inform scientific discussion, especially in the genomics literature.",

    "description": "Abstract: A cyber attacker needs to find only one way in, while defenders need to guard a lot of ground. Adversaries can fully debug and perfect their attacks on their own computers, exactly replicating the environment that they will later be targeting. This is the situation today, which has been exacerbated by an increasing trend towards a software \"monoculture,\" in which there are only two major desktop operating systems, two major phone operating systems, one major office software suite, and so on.\n\nOne possible defense is based on making the targets more dissimilar from each other, which raises the cost to attackers since they need to adapt their attack to each specific target. An alternative defense is based on creating a model of what a \"correct\" program does, and enforcing that model at run-time. I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these two approaches and their evolution over the past two decades. Unfortunately, attackers are evolving too, resulting in a \"cat and mouse\" situation in which defenses are almost always reactive to attacks that have already been observed.\nI will discuss my vision of how to get ahead of the attackers, and close by stating why, in spite of the bleak situation today, I am confident that we will eventually be able to stop most kinds of low-level cyber attacks completely.\nBio: Michael Franz is a Distinguished Professor at the University of California, Irvine (UCI) and the director of its Secure Systems and Software Laboratory. He is a Professor of Computer Science in UCI's Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences and a Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (by courtesy) in UCI's Henry Samueli School of Engineering. He is a Fellow of the AAAS, ACM, IEEE, and IFIP, a recipient of ACM's Charles P. Thacker Breakthrough in Computing Award, the IEEE Computer Society's Technical Achievement Award, and a Humboldt Research Award.\n\nProf. Franz was an early pioneer in the areas of mobile code and dynamic compilation. He created an early just-in-time compilation system, contributed to the theory and practice of continuous compilation and optimization, and co-invented the trace compilation technology that eventually became the JavaScript engine in Mozilla\u2019s Firefox browser. His pioneering contributions to computer security include moving-target defenses inspired by biodiversity in nature, and automated multivariant execution. He has graduated 36 Ph.D. students as their primary advisor. Franz received a Dr. sc. techn. degree in Computer Science and a Dipl. Informatik-Ing.
